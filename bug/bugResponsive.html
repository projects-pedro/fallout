			<tr><td>acrobatic strike</td><td>Your dexterous maneuvers and skilled acrobatics allow you to slip past a foe's defenses and deliver an accurate strike against him. You must attempt at a Hard Coordination check as part of your attack. Whether or not this Coordination check succeeds or fails, you suffer 3 Strain. If you succeed, you gain a bonus on the Brawl or Melee combat check that you make against that foe as long as the attack occurs before the end of your current turn.</td></tr>
